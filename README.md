# Employee Shift Scheduler Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Employee Shift Scheduler** is a multi-language project that automates employee shift scheduling. The system ensures:
- **No employee works more than one shift per day.**
- **Each employee can work a maximum of 5 days per week.**
- **Each shift has at least 2 employees.**
- **Shift conflicts are resolved dynamically.**

This project has been implemented in two different programming languages:
- **Python (GUI-based using Tkinter)**
- **Java (Terminal-based application)**
